Welcome to the mbbox development environment!

Here are some tips:

* The code is located at ~/devel/

* Predefined configuration file is located at ~/mbbox-dev.yml

* Then run mbbox script:
  $ cd devel
  # If you run the script before don't forget to remove current state
  $ rm -rf state
  $ sudo ./main.py ~/mbbox-dev.yml

* If you need to login to openshift:
  $ oc login -u developer
  # password: admin

* To recreate openshift project:
  $ oc delete project mbox
  $ oc new-project mbox

Happy hacking!
